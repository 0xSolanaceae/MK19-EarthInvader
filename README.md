# Earth-Invader v0.1
Discord bot using the cryptography toolkit of [Cryptex](https://github.com/AlexKollar/Cryptex)

## Usage
Usage continues the trend of the Cryptex suite often. See the help menu by simply using `*help`.

## Setting up yourself
Should you want to use the code yourself, you need only replace the Discord token in `main.py`. You can see more documentation on this on the original [Scarab](https://github.com/Soulsender/Scarab) bot.

#### Token
You will need to add your own token in `main.py` under `client.run()`. It is reccommended that it is stored in a `.env` file for better security. This `.env` file should be located in the root of the project directory. Simply add your token in the file as:

```
TOKEN=your token here
```

#### Discord Developer 
You will also need to make your own [discord developer](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) account to aquire said token.

#### Invite Link
You will need to make an invite link in your discord developer portal.
