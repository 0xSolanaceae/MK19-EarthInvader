# Earth-Invader
Discord bot using the cryptography toolkit of [Cryptex](https://github.com/AlexKollar/Cryptex)

### Usage
Usage continues the trend of the Cryptex suite often. See the help menu by simply using `*help`.

### Setting up yourself
Should you want to use the code yourself, you need only replace the Discord token in `main.py`. You can see more documentation on this on the original [Scarab](https://github.com/Soulsender/Scarab) bot.
